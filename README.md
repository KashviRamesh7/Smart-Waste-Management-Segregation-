# Smart-Waste-Management-Segregation-
This project is a smart dustbin that automatically opens its lid when an object is detected. It uses an Arduino to read data from an ultrasonic sensor and an IR sensor, controlling a servo motor to open and close the lid. The code demonstrates basic sensor-based automation and servo control.
